# Welcome To My Page!
## Hello There! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kyle Huynh, and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine, studying Data Science! I have a passion for all things data ðŸ“ˆ, and I find the entire data lifecycleâ€”from cleaning and visualization to modeling and deploymentâ€”fascinating.

Currently, I participate in research focusing on machine learning and deep learning models in the fields of health and environmental sciences. While my primary interest lies in data science, this profile showcases my various passion projects developed over the years!
